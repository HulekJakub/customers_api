# Customers API by Jakub Hulek

## Architecture
I used Port Adapter architecture implemented with Spring Boot using built-in dependency injection.  

## How to run 
Open project with IntelliJ, if not present create new spring boot app configuration.   
Enter "com.jhulek.customers.CustomersApplication" into "Main class" field. Save and run.  

## How to test
You can use any API tester. I used Postman and I also added simple test scenarios which you can import from "esatto cusotmers.postman_collection.json"
